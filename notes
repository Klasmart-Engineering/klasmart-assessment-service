New tables:
- room_ids
- teacher_comment
- teacher_score
- answerAndScore
- userContentScore

level 1:
- just the 3 queries (slow approach)
level 2:
- fetch report from db, if not, calculate and cache it
level 3:
- save pre-computed result as the results come in
level 4:
- use spark for live near-live processing


"Cache":
- use Postgres to save report in database


Authentication:
- does this teacher teach this class
- students can't see results of other students
- parents can only see their children
- admins can see all teachers

Request comes in:
- class finished ? if not => nullable
- if yes => compute report
- if yes (repeated) => return cached
